  <p><strong>FixMyStreet is coming to Northamptonshire soon!</strong> In Spring
  2019, this council will be adopting FixMyStreet as its official street
  reporting platform.</p>

  <p>But until then:</p>

    If you’d like Northamptonshire to receive and handle your report, please
    <strong>report it directly</strong> on their website
  </a>

  <a href="/" class="unresponsive-council-cta">
    You can still make a FixMyStreet report if you’d like to. This will be
    published on our website, but not forwarded to the council.
