<h1> FAQs </h1>

<h2> How can I report a pothole, street or road problem? </h2>

<p>
This web site is designed to help Warwickshire residents to report local
highway faults, including potholes, directly and quickly to us by simply
locating them on a map. You can do this by using your computer or your mobile
phone.
</p>

<p>
Please report one problem at a time; you will be given an opportunity at the
end to report another problem using the personal details previously entered. 
</p>

<p>
If you are reporting an emergency please do not report it online, but ring our
Customer Service Centre on <tt>01926 410410</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Although Warwickshire County Council isn't responsible for the maintenance of
all things listed in the categories an email will be sent to the appropriate
organisation. This will contain the details of your fault report.
</p>

<p>
Uploaded photos and locations from your smart phone or tablet, in particular,
can greatly assist our Highways department in determining pothole repair
priorities.
</p>

<p>
The level of response is dependent on the location, size and risk the pothole
poses to public safety. This may result in the pothole either being repaired
within 28 days if it is identified as a safety risk; or being repaired as part
of other programmed works; or being monitored as part of the routine
inspections programme as the risk to public safety is not sufficient to merit
any immediate action.
</p>

<h2> What isn't it for? </h2>

<p>
The web site is not a way of getting in touch with the council for all issues -
please use it only for problems highlighted above. As we often route problems
via our cleansing services or highways departments, using the site for other
matters may result in a delay in your report getting to the right people.
</p>

<strong>You will need to</strong> contact the <strong>county council
    directly</strong> for:

<ul>
    <li> Any urgent or emergency problems
    <li> Complaining about the council
    <li> Any proposals for speed bumps, pedestrian crossings or new road layouts etc.
</ul>

<h2> How do I use the reporting tool on the site? </h2>

<p>
After entering a postcode or location, you will then be presented with a map of
that area. You can then view problems already reported in that area, or report
any one of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of the
problem.
</p>

<h2> How are the problems solved? </h2>

<p>
They are reported to us automatically. We then resolve the problem the way we
normally would. We are planning for updates to appear automatically however,
this will not be available on this initial version. We are gathering feedback
for further development of this reporting tool. If you have any suggestions,
please email <a href="mailto:fmstest@warwickshire.gov.uk">fmstest@warwickshire.gov.uk</a>.
</p>

<h2> What does the map show? </h2>

<p>
The map shows all faults submitted online. You can view the exact location of
each fault and see its current status.
</p>

<h2> What updates will I receive? </h2>

<p>
When you record a fault you can sign up to receive updates and you will receive
an initial email to acknowledge the report. 
</p>

<p>
You will then receive an email every time that fault is updated. This could be
when a member of the public posts an update onto the fault or when we post a status update. 
</p>

<p>
All of these updates will also be posted on the mapped fault so that anyone can
see the status of any fault recorded by clicking on it on the map.
</p>

<h2> Can I report a fault on my mobile? </h2>

<p>
Yes, you can view our website on your phone or tablet and it will automatically
adapt to the size of your screen.
</p>

<h2> Inappropriate use </h2>

<p>
Warwickshire County Council is not responsible for the content and accuracy of
material submitted by its users. Warwickshire County Council will monitor this
website for instances of inappropriate use, and reserves the right to moderate
comments if such instances occur.
</p>

<h2> Why does the site use kilometres for measurements? </h2>

<p>
The maps are from Ordnance Survey who based their grid reference system on
measurements in metres and kilometres.
