<dl>

    <dt>What is this site?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet Bucks is a site to allow people to make reports to
    Buckinghamshire County Council, and view, or discuss local issues they’ve
    found, by simply locating them on a map.</dd>

    <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyStreet?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet Bucks is primarily for reporting things which are
    <strong>broken or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, or clearing</strong>, such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Flooding
    <li>Grit bins
    <li>Rubbish or flytipping
    <li>Potholes
    <li>Street signs and traffic lights
    <li>Unlit lampposts
    </ul>
    We may send some reports to the relevant District Council especially for:
    <ul>
    <li>Abandoned vehicles
    <li>Flytipping or litter
    <li>Streetcleaning, such as broken glass in a cycle lane
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>What isn’t FixMyStreet for?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with Buckinghamshire
    County Council for all issues – please use this site only for problems
    such as the above. We often route problem reports to the Parish and District
    council, so using this site for other matters may result in a delay in
    your report getting to the right department.
    <p><strong>You will need to contact the relevant authority directly for problems such as</strong>:

    <ul><li>Anti-social behaviour
    <li>Any urgent or emergency problems
    <li>Noise pollution or barking dogs
    <li>Fires and smoke/smell pollution
    <li>Missing wheelie bins or recycling boxes or missed rubbish collections
    <li>Complaining about your neighbours
    <li>Joy riding, drug taking, animal cruelty, or other criminal activity should be reported to the Police Service.
    </ul>
    <p>Complaints about Buckinghamshire County Council can be sent <a href="https://www.buckscc.gov.uk/services/contact-and-complaints/compliments-complaints-and-suggestions/">via this form</a>.

<h2><a name="practical"></a>Practical Questions</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet Bucks is not responsible for the content and
    accuracy of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to
    edit or remove any problems or updates which we consider to be
    inappropriate upon being informed by a user of the site.</dd>

    <dt>Why can’t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep FixMyStreet Bucks locally focused, so restrict
    the ability to move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will
    let you see all the reports you’ve made, wherever they are.</dd>
