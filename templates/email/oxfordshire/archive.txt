Subject: Your reports on [% site_name %]

Hello [% user.name %],

FixMyStreet is being updated in Oxfordshire to improve how problems get fixed.

As part of these updates, we are closing old reports that appear to be resolved but remain open in the system.

We noticed that you have [% report_count %] old [% nget('report', 'reports', report_count) %] on the system, which we've listed below.

If your report is no longer an issue, you don't need to do anything.

If you believe that your report is still a problem, you can reopen it by clicking or copying and pasting
the link marked 'View report' by a report and leaving an update.
