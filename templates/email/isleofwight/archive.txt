Subject: Your reports on FixMyStreet

Hello [% user.name %],

FixMyStreet is being updated for the Isle of Wight to improve how problems get reported.

As part of this process we are closing all enquiries made before the update. We noticed
that you have [% report_count %] old [% nget('report', 'reports', report_count) %] on the system, which we've listed below.

If your enquiry is no longer an issue, you don't need to do anything. If you believe
that the issue has not been resolved, please log it again on
https://fms.islandroads.com/ or contact the Island Roads Help Desk via info@islandroads.com or 01983 822440.
