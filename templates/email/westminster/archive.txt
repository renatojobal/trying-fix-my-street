Subject: Your reports on [% site_name %]

Hello [% user.name %],

FixMyStreet is being updated in Westminster to improve how problems get reported.

As part of this process we are closing all reports made before the update.

We noticed that you have [% report_count %] old [% nget('report', 'reports', report_count) %] on the system, which we've listed below.

All of your reports will have been received and reviewed by Westminster, so if your report is no longer an issue, you don't need to do anything.

If you believe that the issue has not been resolved you can report it again here: https://report.westminster.gov.uk/
