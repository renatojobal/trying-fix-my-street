Subject: Your reports on [% site_name %]

Hello [% user.name %],

Thank you for taking the time to report this issue through FixMyStreet. Rutland County Council have now embedded FixMyStreet within several service areas across the Council, and are adopting this platform as the main reporting tool for all highways and streetscene issues.  We will be integrating this system with existing service delivery software.

As such, we have taken a decision to close reports prior to 1/5/2018.

We noticed that you have [% report_count %] old [% nget('report', 'reports', report_count) %] on the system, which we've listed below.

If you feel that the issue you reported has not been addressed, please report it again at https://rutland.fixmystreet.com/ or by using the App
