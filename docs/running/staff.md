# Staff users in FixMyStreet

<p class="lead">Privileged accounts with access to management features.</p>

Staff users are a middle rung of account, inbetween normal users of the site
and superusers with full access to everything. They are associated with a
particular body, and can have access to different features, depending upon the
permissions or roles granted to them. All their abilities only apply to reports
made to the body with which they are associated; all staff users have access to
all report states, not just open/fixed.
