Today we have released **version 2.3.2** of FixMyStreet.

This is a minor release, but one with quite a number of bug fixes and other
smaller front end and admin improvements.

The questionnaire process has been improved, with “Don’t know” now an option in
the email, and recording the answer as soon as the link is clicked. Smaller
front end fixes include increasing the size of “sub map links” (hide pins,
permalink, etc), clicking the "Click map" instruction banner now begins a new
report, and improved cursor/display of the new report pin.

Front end bug fixes include improving chart display in old IE versions, a CSS
padding bug in the sidebar “drawer”, a race condition when making a new report
quickly, some small RTL text display issues, and making sure the loading
spinner is always shown when it should be.

We now store a user’s creation and last active times, and have provided scripts
so you can use tis new information to anonymize inactive users or reports,
email inactive users, and/or close reports to new updates.

At long last, the contents of a report’s extra field is now fully displayed in
the admin.

Open311 has had a number of improvements and bug fixes – we can now fetch
problems over Open311, send multiple photos via an Open311 extension, and have
the ability to have automated attributes that can be filled in but not shown to
the user (e.g.  asset IDs).

For development, we’ve added an HTML email previewer at `/dev/_email/` which
our designers love, added some Cypress browser-based testing so that some of
our JavaScript is also tested, and upgraded our Vagrantfile to use Ubuntu Xenial.
