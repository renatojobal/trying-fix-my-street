Today we're releasing **version 1.2** of the FixMyStreet platform. The
[AMI](/install/ami/) has been updated and the [install
script](/install/install-script/) will automatically now install this version.

The main items in this release are things prompted by requests on [our mailing
list](/community/) :-)

* Postfix is now installed as part of the install script, or in the AMI. This
  means email should work out of the box. For anyone already installed, you can
  run the commands in [the GitHub ticket](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/issues/412).

* A new configuration option `MAPIT_ID_WHITELIST` has been added, to restrict
  usage to the IDs specified, if given. This means Claudio, who emailed last
  week, could have `[ 239540 ]` as his `MAPIT_ID_WHITELIST`, and then reports
  could only be made within the Marche region of Italy. We already use this new
  option ourselves on https://www.zueriwieneu.ch/ where before it was
  hard-coded in the code.

* Other things include being able to zoom in further on OSM maps, and HTML
  pages are now being gzipped.

Lastly, as you can see this site has had a redesign to make it more friendly,
and we've added some more documentation about e.g. updating an AMI instance to
a newer version. If there's anything unclear, please do [ask on the mailing
list](/community/) or submit an issue or pull request on GitHub.
