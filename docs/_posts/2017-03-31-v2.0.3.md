Today we have released **version 2.0.3** of FixMyStreet,
a bugfix release along with some other improvements.

The map on a mobile report page can now be made full screen, and if you are
using Google Maps you can supply a custom map styling. There's also now a
loading indicator whilst data is being fetched for the map.

Various missing translations have been added, for moderation, social login,
and offline usage.

We've upgraded our email sending to deal with issues sending with SSL, dealt
with IE11 caching report Ajax calls too aggressively, and with Safari 5/
Android 4 not showing our questionnaire answer buttons.

Performance improvements include moving admin-related JavaScript to its own
file (so normal users don't need to download it), and reducing the amount of
disk stats the code performs.

Lastly, all the test suite can now run offline, and amusingly I found a bug in
a test that only happened if the test was run c. 55 hours before daylight
savings time began :)
