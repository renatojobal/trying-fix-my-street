Today we have released **version 2.0.2** of FixMyStreet, a bugfix release along
with some new admin improvements.

The main bugfixes are to mark two missing strings for translation, to make sure
email is lowercase when signing in via `/auth`, and to make sure a language
subdomain can be included in calls to `base_url_for_report`. There are also
some CSS fixes to the homepage and an improved print layout for report list
pages. Fixes to the admin interface include fixing filtering on the shortlist
page, and fixing the ‘save with public update’ toggle.

For international users, there have been a few string renames, but we have
maintained translations as the concept remains unchanged, so please only feel
free to update if you consider it necessary:

* ‘unable to fix’ has been renamed to ‘no further action’
* ‘marked as a duplicate report’ has been changed to ‘closed as a duplicate report’

An offline fallback page has been added using appcache, which inspectors can
use for offline updating of reports in their shortlist.

Admin improvements include allowing response templates to be associated with a
state (so that template is used by default when the state is changed), allowing
shortlist addition/removal from report lists, and shortlist reordering. Users
with a new permission can see the body user who left a `contribute_as_body`
report or update.
