Today we have released **version 2.0.4** of FixMyStreet, a bugfix release along
with a couple of other improvements.

The bugfixes are updating our Facebook library so that Facebook login works
again, stopping an error if you had a devolved body and its contact both
lacking a send method, and an issue in the multi-select front end if you had
characters such as brackets in your category name.

Strangely, while the backend has always allowed multiple email addresses for a
contact, separated by commas, the admin interface hasn't allowed them to be
entered - this has now been corrected.

Lastly, body pages under `/reports` will now limit the reports shown to those
within the visible map, which should make moving and zooming around much more
intuitive.
