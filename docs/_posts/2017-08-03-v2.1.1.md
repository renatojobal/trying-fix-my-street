Today we have released **version 2.1.1** of FixMyStreet, a bugfix release with
a few small improvements.

The map in HTML emails is now a link through to the report page, and we've
fixed a bug causing the wrong pin size to be shown there. We've also fixed a
bug that could cause a different language from the requested one to be shown on
about pages.

Admin improvements include resending reports if changing the category
has changed the `send_method` and displaying the reporter's phone number
on the inspector form. Text deleted during moderation is no longer
replaced with `[...]`.
