Weâ€™ve released **version 1.8.1** of FixMyStreet, which fixes some bugs and
makes some improvements to the 1.8 release.

Now there is multiple photo support, the display of those photos on a report
page is now a bit nicer, and if there's an error message on photo upload it
should now always be visible. Auto-scrolling of the sidebar when you hover over
a pin has been removed as it was confusing, and the site now remembers a user's
last anonymous state. Fixes have been made for running on more recent versions
of Perl, one of which was causing the geocoder to break.

For developers, an easier way of adding cobrand-specific custom reporting
fields has been added.

There are a couple of other minor changes; see the full list of changes
[over on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases).
