Weâ€™ve released **version 1.8.3** of FixMyStreet.

For developers, the main improvement in this version is the great speed up to
CSS compilation by moving from sass to libsass.

We've fixed some map issues, getting the Google Maps layer working again and
dealing with tap sensitivity on some devices.

The admin interface gets a bit of love, adding common search boxes to the index
page, allowing change of email to an existing address, and speeding up photo
removal.

### Upgrading notes

If your templates aren't kept in the main repository, there are a couple of
things to be aware of with this release:

* If you've used the `cf` class, you'll need to rename it to `clearfix`.
* If you have customised any of the email templates that use `<?=...?>` style
  variables (e.g. alert emails, questionnaire, submit), you'll need to
  rewrite them to use the standard `[%...%]` variables.
