Today we have released **version 2.0.1** of FixMyStreet, a bugfix release.
The issues fixed are:

* Chrome 55 changes the way it handles mouse/touch events, [unifying them as
  pointer events](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/pointer-events),
  and OpenLayers, the JavaScript mapping library we use, needed patching to
  deal with this. Thanks to the Chrome team for helping debug this.
* strftime output (e.g. used to display dates) was sometimes being double
  decoded, giving incorrect output in some languages.
* If a category was filtered, it was not being properly carried through to the
  new report form.
* The body/area inputs in the admin were being fixed to a too-small height.

Some bugfixes and improvements have also been made to the admin inspector
report view, along with a couple of development improvements â€“ the tests coping
better if run on a network that intercepts NXDOMAINs, and a better way of
showing the git version in the admin config.
