Say hello to **version 1.4** of FixMyStreet. As usual, the [install
script](/install/install-script/) and [AMI](/install/ami/) have both been
updated to this version.

Hopefully this release will run more smoothly on EC2 micro instances, with some
cron rejigging to alleviate memory problems.

There have been a few minor user-facing improvements, such as automatically
selecting the reporting category if there's only one choice, and removing the
indenting of emails; some bug fixes, including changes for the new version of
Debian, a problem with language setting in email alerts, and removal of cached
photos; and a number of improvements for people reusing the code, including a
no-op send method, having reports on staging sites be sent to the reporter,
adding an external URL field to bodies, and making it easier to change the pin
icons.

See the full changes over on GitHub at
