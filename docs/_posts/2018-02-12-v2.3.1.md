Today we have released **version 2.3.1** of FixMyStreet.

This is a minor release, with a number of bug fixes but also a number of
smaller front end and admin improvements.

The site should be clearer when things are loading now, be that on initial page
load or when an asset layer is incoming. Our phone number library has been
updated, so national phone numbers should be displayed in a nicer format as
long as you've set the `PHONE_COUNTRY` variable.

FixMyStreet now asks for the current password (or sends an email) on password
change, sets a minimum password length and checks against a list of commons
passwords. Superusers can have optional two-factor authentication to protect
their accounts.

We fixed an error in sending `requires_inspection` reports, issues with
multiple select-multiples on a page, a questionnaire CSS snafu, showing deleted
bodies in the dashboard list, alongside other minor bugfixes.

For staff users, 'report as another user' now allows phone number without
email, and the inspector form shows any extra fields again.

Admins can now anonymize/hide all a user's reports, log a user out, or remove a
user's account details. We've provided a script to expire old sessions in the
database (plus this script can be run with `--init` to set up the database for
the new "log a user out" feature).
