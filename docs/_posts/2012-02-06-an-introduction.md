[FixMyStreet](https://www.fixmystreet.com/) in 2007 in order to make it easy for
people in the UK to report problems in their area. Since then over
[200,000 problems](https://www.mysociety.org/2012/01/24/fixmystreet-another-big-number/)
have been reported to UK councils using the site. As with all our
sites we want people everywhere to be able to benefit so we were delighted to
work with the Norwegian Unix Userâ€™s Group ([NUUG](http://www.nuug.no))
last year to set up a [FixMyStreet in Norway](http://www.fiksgatami.no/).

We want to build on that and help more people around the world install their
own copy of FixMyStreet. In the months since
[FiksGataMi](http://www.fiksgatami.no/) was launched we&#8217;ve made a number
of changes to FixMyStreet to make it easier to install and customise for other
countries. We&#8217;ve rewritten much of the code to use the
[Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/) web framework which has
helped make it easier to customise and we&#8217;re now improving the
documentation and ironing out the installation procedure.

However, we know that easy to install code is only part of the process.
Building a community around the software is far more valuable in encouraging
people to use and improve it. This site and the new
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/mysociety.org/forum/#!forum/fixmystreet)
are our first steps along that road.

So, if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to have a FixMyStreet for your town, state or
country then join the mailing list and we&#8217;ll help you along the way.
