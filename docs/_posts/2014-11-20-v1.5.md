We’ve released **version 1.5** of FixMyStreet. This version fully supports the
new Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu, Trusty Tahr 14.04 (the code did
already run fine on Ubuntu Trusty if you set it up manually, but now the
install script will work and a few other bits have been tidied).

This release comes with a few improvements to the admin interface, including
pagination of search results, validation of new categories, and some display
enhancements.

We've moved the map sidebar to be flush with the window edge, which we think is
simpler and easier on the eye, and we've continued making the template
structure easier to change and override.

We've also fixed some bugs, such as map submission not working with JavaScript
disabled or unavailable. As another example, we had a report of the Android
browser crashing when showing a map page, which we tracked down to the slightly
transparent map navigation controls – crashing wasn't worth this, so now on
mobile they're fully opaque.

From [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/fixmystreet/) we've added
four new languages (as well as updating the existing ones):
Albanian, Bulgarian, Hebrew, and Ukranian.

As always, do [ask on the mailing list](/community/) if you'd like more
information on any of the above, or submit an issue or pull request on GitHub.
