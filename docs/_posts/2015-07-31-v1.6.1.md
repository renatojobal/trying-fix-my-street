Weâ€™ve released **version 1.6.1** of FixMyStreet.

This release fixes a bug introduced in the previous release when setting
multiple areas for a body in the administration interface.

It also includes improvements to the All Reports page, adding a fixed header
and tooltips, and stops the sidebar running over the footer on alerts pages.
The admin gets a variety of minor improvements, with better internal linking
and a mark as sent button. Plus a Danish translation :)

As ever, see the full list of changes
[over on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases).
