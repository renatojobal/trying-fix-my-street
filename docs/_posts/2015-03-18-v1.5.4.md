Weâ€™ve released **version 1.5.4** of FixMyStreet.

This includes a couple of new map layers, Bing Maps and Stamen's
[toner-lite](http://maps.stamen.com/toner-lite/), and nicer confirmation pages
for after you've made a report or update, along with other smaller improvements
and bug fixes. See the full list of changes
[over on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases).

For developers, it includes a few small improvements, to do with Mac
installation, making some things optional, and including a new configuration
variable for if you're running behind an SSL proxy. We've also added some test
URLs so that you can view confirmation pages without having to leave a new
report or update, e.g. see it in action on fixmystreet.com:
[https://www.fixmystreet.com/P/\_test\_](https://www.fixmystreet.com/P/_test_).

As always, do [ask on the mailing list](/community/) if you'd like more
information on any of the above, or submit an issue or pull request on GitHub.
