Weâ€™ve released **version 1.8.4** of FixMyStreet, along with versions 1.7.2 and 1.6.3.

These releases include a security fix, closing two
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Please update
your installation as soon as possible.

Version 1.8.4 also contains other minor bug fixes, such as correctly
orientating preview images, wrapping emails better for differing screen sizes,
a bug with filter redirect when JavaScript wasn't available, a race condition
when starting a new report, and a couple of display bugs in IE7.

See the full list of changes
[over on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases).
