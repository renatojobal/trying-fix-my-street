We’ve released **version 1.8** of FixMyStreet.

The two main new features in this release are *Facebook login* – provide a
Facebook app ID and secret in your configuration and it will smoothly fit into
the creation and login flow – and *multiple photo support*, along with a modern
interface for previewing and uploading photos whilst you create your report.

Smaller improvements include *highlighting the pin* when you hover over an item
in the sidebar, and vice-versa; fixing some small display bugs such as how
updates were displayed in Your Reports and preventing a chevron being stretched
in Firefox; improving the look of the 404 page, and making sure you can see an
update if you got to it via an in-page link.

Memory *performance* has been improved, meaning cron jobs can take up to half
as much memory, and this release also fixes a number of small bugs, including
an embarrassing swap of latitude and longitude in the Google geocoder, making
sure you're signed up for updates if you used the app and were logged in, and
better internationalisation and display of numbers.

For *developers*, we've added a generic static route handler, so that adding
new static HTML pages to your installation involves only creating a new file in
your template directory and nothing more; improved bounce handling; and fixed
the cobrand restriction handling on Your Reports and list pages.

Plus quite a few other things; as always, see the full list of changes
[over on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases).
