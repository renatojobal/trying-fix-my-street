Today we have released **version 2.4.1** of FixMyStreet.

This release contains a wide variety of new features for use by reusers of our software,
funded by [NDI](https://www.ndi.org/) as part of their FixMyCommunity project; thanks
very much to them. It also includes a number of smaller features and bugfixes.

FixMyStreet now comes with a Dockerfile and example Docker Compose setup for
use by those tools, and we provide a hosted Vagrant box that can be used also.
You can choose to store photos in Amazon S3 rather then the local filesystem,
use an external memcache server,

We've added a script, `cobrand-checks`, that will list/diff template changes in core
that might need applying to a cobrand, to help with upgrading, and added more checks
to our Pull Requests on GitHub to spot included cobrands that need checking with each
PR made.

We have sped up fetching full lists of bodies to help installs that have
thousands of bodies, sped up the display of `/_dev` pages, fixed the display of
pins on a body page when using Bing or TonerLite maps, and fixed an issue where the
`from_body` field was lost on a user when edited by a non-superuser admin.
