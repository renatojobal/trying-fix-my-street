Weâ€™ve released **version 1.7** of FixMyStreet.

This version adds some new features. First off is that the FixMyStreet design
is now *bi-directional*, providing an easy switch to flip the design to either
left-to-right or right-to-left. This was done with the kind support of the
National Democratic Institute.

We have added *state and category filters* to the list pages, letting users
view only e.g. open reports in the potholes category, or all reports in the
graffiti category. Various design improvements have been made, including the
showing of the report on a questionnaire page and the email confirmation pages,
and we've added a nicer default OpenGraph image.

Database *performance* has been improved in a number of areas, and the
accessibility of the map pages has been improved.

This release also fixes a number of small *bugs*, including translating report
states in the admin index, dealing with DMARC email issues, and fixes for
Google Maps API users.

For *developers*, we've made it easier to run gettext-extract if you're
performing your own translations, removed some confusing warnings, finally
removed the final few hardcoded "FixMyStreet" strings so it's easy to rename
your site, streamlined the navigation menu and list item CSS using a BEM style
naming scheme so it is easy to change and override, and lastly fixed a long
standing issue where errors were not always logged correctly.

Plus quite a few other things; as always, see the full list of changes
[over on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases).
