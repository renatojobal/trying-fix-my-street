Today we have released **version 2.4.2** of FixMyStreet.

This is mainly a bugfix release, but does contain a couple of new features -
the admin lets you see and manage a userâ€™s alerts, and the dashboard has update
CSV export.

Bugfixes include an issue when setting up a new Vagrant-based installation,
updating the areas column when a report is moved by a staff user, giving
superusers access to update staff dropdown, and an issue with subcategories
when visiting /report/new directly.

We have renamed a few SCSS variables for clarity; the old names still work, but
if you wish to update your cobrand, then change `$map_nav_bg` to
`$nav_background_colour`, `$nav_fg` to `$nav_colour`, and `$nav_fg_hover` to
`$nav_hover_background_colour`.
