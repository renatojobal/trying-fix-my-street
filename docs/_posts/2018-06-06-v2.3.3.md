Today we have released **version 2.3.3** of FixMyStreet.

This fixes a few bugs found in the past week of the last release, including one
potential data leak. It was possible to obtain from a crafted URL the textual
content of an update, and the name of the user who left that update (only if
they had made the update non-anonymously), even if that update was unconfirmed
or hidden. No other details of the update or user were made available.

Other fixes include incorrect behaviour when selecting report pins on mobile,
bad admin navigation links in multi-language installs, and an issue with the
map display when an inspector clicked back from a report page on mobile.
