We’ve released **version 1.4.2**, a maintenance release, but also with a couple
of new features. The main reason for this release was to fix a couple of issues
with the installation script, which are hopefully now resolved. It also
upgrades our bundled copy of `cpanm` (to cope better when an external module
website is down), tidies up the template structure, copes with browser autofill
on the `/auth` sign in page, and adds links from the All Reports page to a
body’s open or fixed reports.

The main new feature is the addition of SMTP username/password and SSL/TLS
options for your setup. You can read about the new options on
[the configuration settings page](/customising/config/#smtp_smarthost)

As always, do [ask on the mailing list](/community/) if you'd like more
information on any of the above, or submit an issue or pull request on GitHub.
