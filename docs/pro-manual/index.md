# What is FixMyStreet Pro?

## History & background

<img alt="This is FixMyStreet Pro" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/all-the-sites.png" />

FixMyStreet Pro is a service for councils, which grew out of the website FixMyStreet.com.
Set up in 2007 by the not-for-profit organisation mySociety, and still running today,
FixMyStreet.com ​makes it simple for any citizen to report a public street issue, such as graffiti,
broken streetlights, unsafe paving, highways maintenance or potholes. It covers the whole of the
UK.

Reports made through FixMyStreet.com are published on the website and sent — primarily by
email — to the correct UK council for resolution. Councils do not need to have purchased
FixMyStreet Pro in order to receive these reports, but FixMyStreet Pro adds enhanced functionality
for staff users, as well as the ability to integrate a tailored version of FixMyStreet on the council
website as their fault reporting interface.

FixMyStreet has a number of benefits for users. These include:
-  A strong focus on usability, with an interface that practically anyone can use and
understand;
-  No knowledge required as to which council is responsible for a report: the website sends
reports to the correct authority based on the category and location selected;
-  Reports are published online, building up a picture of issues in the area, so it’s easy to see
recurrent problems and resolution rates.
There are benefits for councils, too:
-  Reports are sent to the correct authority, based on category and location;
-  Because reports are published online, residents can easily see if an issue has been
reported before, helping cut down on duplicates;
-  The site gives residents a clear illustration of the often otherwise hidden work the council
has been doing to improve neighbourhoods and communities.

In 2012, mySociety began to develop FixMyStreet as a tool which would be as useful for council
staff as it is for citizens. FixMyStreet Pro is now a fully-featured cloud-based service which not only
allows councils to place the report-making functionality on their own websites, but which also provides a number of tools to make report tracking, prioritising and resolution simpler. These have
been developed in consultation with UK councils.

## FixMyStreet Pro’s features for council staff

FixMyStreet Pro offers enhanced features to client councils, including:

-  Simple channels of communication with report makers, through status updates and
template responses
