Compiling OpenLayers
====================

Use the master branch of the https://github.com/mysociety/ol2 repository (which
is currently one commit ahead of the final OpenLayers commit to work around a
Content-Security-Policy issue).

Put a copy of the Closure Compiler JAR file in tools/closure-compiler.jar – 
currently using the v20160713 version, a more recent version (not sure exactly
when) does fail to compile.

Then the following should work:
    python build.py -c closure path/to/file.cfg path/to/OpenLayers.file.js
