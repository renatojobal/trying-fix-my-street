The code is broken down into the following sections:

* Website: code to display the website and handle user submissions

* Backend: send reports to the councils, work out who should get alerts,
  send questionnaires, and so on

* Mobile apps: currently for iPhone and Android - two separate apps, with
  a PhoneGap app being worked on.

* Utility scripts: odds and ends
